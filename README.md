# IBIEM Communication

1. Technical questions and discussion for the course will be held in the *Issues* of the IBIEM/community repository on Github.  This includes questions about: R, Github, submitting assignments, problems with the IBIEM computing environment.  Note that this is a public repository, so don't post anything you don't want the Internet to see, but also remember that if you have a technical question, you are probably not the only one.

2. Non-technical question for the whole IBIEM Staff (Claudia, Glenda, Josh, Xin, Alex, Kristen, Eluka, Scott), should be sent to the *ibieminstructors* mailing list: [email address redacted].

3. For questions directed at specific IBIEM Staff or private matters, email the relevant individual(s) directly.


## Posting an Issue
To access *Issues* click on the *Issues* tab above (the one between *Code* and *Pull requests*, not the Issues link at the very top of the page.  Or click [here](https://github.com/IBIEM/community/issues).

To start a new thread, create a new issue. Tag your peers using their handle—@granek, for example—to get their attention.

Once a question is answered, the issue will be closed, so lots of good answers might end up in closed issues. Don't forget to look there when looking for answers.

You can also use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.

Guidelines for posting questions:

- First search existing issues (open or closed) for answers. If the question has already been answered, you're done! If there is an open issue, feel free to contribute to it. Or feel free to open a closed issue if you believe the answer is not satisfactory.
- Give your issue an informative title.
    + Good: "Error: could not find function "ggplot""
    + Bad: "R giving errors", "help me!", “aaaarrrrrgh!”
Note that you can edit an issue’s title after it's been posted.
- Format your questions nicely using markdown and code formatting. Preview your issue prior to posting.
- Where appropriate, provide links to specific files, or even lines within them, in the body of your issue. This will help your helper understand your question. Note that only the teaching team will have access to private repos.
- (Optional) Tag someone or some group of people. Start by typing the @ symbol and GitHub will generate some good suggestions. You can also type or paste in the GitHub username yourself. Examples: to tag Josh, use `@granek`; to tag Josh and the TAs use  `@IBIEM/owners`, to tag a class/team mate use their GitHub username.
- Hit "Submit new issue" when you're ready to post.
